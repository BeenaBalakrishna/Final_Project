# INTRODUCTION

Providing a healthy and safe environment to the mankind has always been one of the primary objectives of WHO and UNICEF. These organisations are striving hard to bridge the gap between the proposed objectives and delivering those services. Despite all the efforts, yet hundreds of millions of people face an increased risk of infection by seeking care in health facilities that lack basic necessities, including water, sanitation, hygiene, health care waste management and cleaning (WASH) services. Not only does the lack of WASH services in health care facilities compromise patient safety and dignity, it also has the potential to exacerbate the spread of antimicrobial-resistant infections and undermines efforts to improve child and maternal health. 
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) place a new emphasis on universal health coverage, including access to WASH services. They also reflect a shift in thinking that recognizes the importance of quality care and an integrated, people-centered approach that enhances the experience of care. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), through the WHO/ UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), have produced regular updates on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) since 1990. Together, they are responsible for monitoring the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets 6.1 and 6.2 and supporting global monitoring of other WASH-related SDG targets and indicators. 

# PROJECT PURPOSE 

The analysis performed in this project will provide an insight on how the economic status of a country affects the health care conditions of its citizens. 

# PROJECT HYPOTHESIS

This project aims to generate an analytical model to determine the progress made in the global health care conditions in the developed and under-developed countries for the year 2017. 

# CONCLUSIONS 

Prior assumption was that the developed countries would take more care towards increasing the hygiene conditions than compared to the developing countries based on the primary influencing factor: economic status of the country. But post performing the analysis, an inference can be drawn that the priorities and objectives of developed and developing countries define the hygienic condition. The focus areas of developing countries are inclined towards improving the conditions of cleanliness, employment, population control, resource production, education quality, etc. Whereas the focus area of the developed countries is inclined towards research, science – technology innovation, education quality, improving the economic status, increasing resource production, etc. On conclusion, the developing countries strive to improve the hygienic conditions whereas the developed countries only maintain and monitor the hygienic conditions.
